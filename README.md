This is the source code to the Andorid application __BabyFace__. BabyFace let's you create videos of your children and loved ones by taking pictures at regular intervals and then combining those to a single movie. To make the best out of your videos, BabyFace has a smart image processing system built in which runs a couple of pre-processing steps on your photos, such as centering the face on the photo, before creating the video.
